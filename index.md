Welcome! You can find my CV here.

I am an Assistant Professor of Finance at the Trulaske College of Business at the University of Missouri.

My research focuses on alternative investments (private equity and hedge funds), institutional investors such as university endowments, foundations, and pension funds, and empirical corporate finance.

I received a Ph.D. in Finance from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in May 2020. I earned B.S. and M.Sc. (summa cum laude) in Finance from Bocconi University. While at Bocconi, I spent a semester at the University of California, San Diego, and at the University of Florida. 

Prior to the Ph.D., I worked for the Debt Capital Markets (DCM) and Structured Finance team of Mediobanca, an Italian investment bank.  I am a CFA® charter holder.

My hobbies include running, playing soccer, and cooking.  Before attending college, I played professional and semi-professional soccer in Italy. My wife Casey is an emergency room nurse and teaching professor at the University of Missouri. We have a daughter named Mia. I am also a long-term cancer survivor (primary mediastinal large B cell lymphoma) and actively participate in fundraising activities.
